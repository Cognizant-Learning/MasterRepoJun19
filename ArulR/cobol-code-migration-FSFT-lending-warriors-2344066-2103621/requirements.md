# Requirements for COBOL Code Migration to Modern UI Application

## 1. Legacy System Analysis

### 1.1 Overview
The existing legacy system is built in COBOL and consists of three main components:
- `main.cob`: Contains the primary program flow and orchestrates the application's functionality
- `operations.cob`: Implements the business logic and core operations
- `data.cob`: Defines data structures and handles data storage/retrieval operations

### 1.2 Functionality Summary
The legacy COBOL application appears to be a data processing system that handles:
- Customer record management
- Transaction processing
- Reporting functionality
- Data validation and verification

## 2. Migration Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals
- Preserve all existing business functionality
- Modernize the user interface for improved usability
- Implement a scalable, maintainable architecture
- Ensure data integrity during and after migration

### 2.2 Success Criteria
- All core functions of the legacy system are available in the new application
- Performance meets or exceeds the legacy system
- Zero data loss during migration
- Improved user experience and workflow efficiency
