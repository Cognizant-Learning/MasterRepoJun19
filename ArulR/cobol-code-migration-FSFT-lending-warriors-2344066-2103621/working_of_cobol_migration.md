COBOL Banking System Code Analysis
This is a simple banking system implemented in COBOL with three main programs:

MainProgram (main.cob)
Operations (operations.cob)
DataProgram (data.cob)
Overall Architecture
The system uses a modular design with three separate COBOL programs that interact through CALL statements:

MainProgram serves as the entry point with a menu interface
Operations handles banking transactions (view, credit, debit)
DataProgram manages data persistence (read/write balance)
Program Details
MainProgram (main.cob)
This program:

Displays a menu interface with 4 options
Uses a loop with a CONTINUE-FLAG to keep the program running until the user selects Exit
Calls the Operations program passing different operation codes:
'TOTAL ' for balance inquiry
'CREDIT' for deposits
'DEBIT ' for withdrawals
Note the padding with spaces in 'TOTAL ' and 'DEBIT ' to match the 6-character field size
Operations (operations.cob)
This program:

Receives an operation type from MainProgram
Handles three transaction types:
'TOTAL ' - Displays current balance (reads from DataProgram)
'CREDIT' - Adds money to account (reads, updates, then writes through DataProgram)
'DEBIT ' - Presumably withdraws money (code is incomplete in the excerpt)
Uses CALL 'DataProgram' to persist data between sessions
DataProgram (data.cob)
This program:

Acts as a simple data storage mechanism
Maintains account balance in STORAGE-BALANCE
Handles two operations passed from Operations program:
'READ' - Copies stored balance to the passed parameter
'WRITE' - Updates stored balance from the passed parameter
Uses GOBACK to return to the calling program
Key COBOL Concepts Used
Modular programming with separate program units
Data passing between programs via the USING clause
Conditional logic with IF, ELSE IF, and EVALUATE
Decimal handling with PIC 9(6)V99 for monetary values
Program iteration with PERFORM UNTIL loop
Fixed-width fields with space padding for comparison
The incomplete DEBIT operation in operations.cob would likely mirror the CREDIT operation but subtract the amount instead of adding it.
