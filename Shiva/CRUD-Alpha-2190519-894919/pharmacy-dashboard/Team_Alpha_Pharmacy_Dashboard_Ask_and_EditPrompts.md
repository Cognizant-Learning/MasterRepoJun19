# Hackathon Challenge Prompts

## Initial Challenge
We need to create a pharmacy inventory management dashboard capable of adding new pharmacy items to inventory, updating an existing pharmacy item in inventory, reading an existing pharmacy item in inventory and deleting an existing pharmacy item from inventory.

The inventory management app needs to have a User Interface for user interaction and also all CRUD functionality must be driven by CRUD operation APIs.

## Analytics Requirements
We want to integrate some analytics related functionality to view pharmacy inventory item categories. Please suggest what all possible pharmacy related categories available to be added in an inventory.

## Notification Requirements
We want to integrate a notification related functionality in our pharmacy inventory management dashboard. Please suggest.
