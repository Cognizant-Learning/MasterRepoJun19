# Testing Integration Summary

## Overview

In this session, we've developed a comprehensive testing suite for the Pharmacy Dashboard to validate the integration between the frontend components and the mock API implementations. This work ensures the reliability of the notification system and auto-fill feature.

## New Features Added

1. **Automated Testing Suite**
   - Created comprehensive notification system tests (`NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
   - Implemented auto-fill feature tests (`AutoFillFeature.test.tsx`)
   - Enhanced MSW integration test (`msw-integration.test.tsx`)

2. **Test Scripts**
   - Added cross-platform test execution scripts (`run-tests.bat` and `run-tests.ps1`)
   - These scripts install necessary testing libraries and run the test suite

3. **Health Check System**
   - Created a health check script (`check-health.ps1`) to verify system components
   - This script checks if the frontend and mock API server are running correctly
   - Provides troubleshooting advice when issues are detected

4. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Updated testing documentation with automated testing instructions
   - Added health check information to the startup documentation
   - Added test coverage details to explain what's being tested

5. **Advanced Startup Integration**
   - Added health check option to the advanced starter script
   - Makes it easy for users to verify their system state

## Testing Coverage

The testing suite covers:

1. **Notification Types**
   - Low Stock Alerts
   - Out of Stock Alerts
   - Expiration Alerts
   - Price Change Alerts

2. **Auto-Fill Functionality**
   - Automatic replenishment of out-of-stock items
   - Error handling for auto-fill failures
   - Auto-fill settings enforcement

3. **API Integration**
   - CRUD operations for inventory items
   - Notification API endpoints
   - Auto-fill API endpoints

4. **Error Handling**
   - Server errors (500)
   - Client errors (400)
   - Not found errors (404)

## Next Steps

1. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add testing to a continuous integration pipeline
   - Automate test execution on code changes

2. **Expanded Test Coverage**
   - Add more component-level tests
   - Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress or Playwright

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Add tests for handling large inventory datasets
   - Test notification system with hundreds of alerts
