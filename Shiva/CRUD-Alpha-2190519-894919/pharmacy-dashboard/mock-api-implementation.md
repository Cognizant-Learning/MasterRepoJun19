# Pharmacy Dashboard Mock API Implementation

## What's Been Created

1. **Enhanced Mock Server (`enhanced-mock-server.js`)**
   - Comprehensive Node.js implementation of the API
   - Complete support for all required endpoints
   - Proper error handling and CORS support
   - Standardized response formatting
   - Support for all notification types and auto-fill operations

2. **Browser-Based Mock API**
   - MSW (Mock Service Worker) implementation in `frontend/src/mocks/`
   - Intercepts API requests directly in the browser
   - No backend dependency required
   - Complete mock data for testing all features

3. **Startup Scripts**
   - PowerShell script (`start-app.ps1`): Easy one-click start
   - Batch file (`start-app.bat`): Alternative Windows startup
   - Direct startup instructions via npm

4. **Documentation**
   - `README.md`: Main application documentation
   - `testing-guide.md`: How to test notification and auto-fill features
   - `MOCK-API-README.md`: Details on the browser-based mock API
   - `startup-options.md`: Comprehensive guide to different startup methods

## Features Supported by the Mock API

### Inventory Management
- View all inventory items
- Create new items
- Update existing items
- Delete items
- Filter and search

### Enhanced Notification System
- **Low Stock Alerts:** When items fall below reorder level
- **Out of Stock Alerts:** When items have zero quantity
- **Expiration Alerts:** Tiered notifications (30/60/90 days)
- **Price Change Alerts:** When item prices change significantly

### Auto-Fill Functionality
- Configure auto-fill settings per item
- Trigger auto-fill for individual items
- Batch auto-fill for all eligible items
- Automatic stock replenishment

### Analytics
- Category-based analytics
- Subcategory reporting
- Inventory value and quantity tracking

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the application using any of the provided methods
2. Navigate the dashboard to view inventory items
3. Check notifications (bell icon) for various alert types
4. Test auto-fill by clicking "Auto Fill" buttons
5. Edit items to configure auto-fill settings and notification preferences

## Next Steps

With the mock API in place, the frontend application can be fully tested without any backend dependency. This approach allows for:

1. Rapid frontend development
2. Isolated testing
3. Demonstration of features without backend configuration
4. Simplified deployment for demo purposes

If integrating with the actual backend, simply disable the mock implementations and point the frontend to the real API endpoints.
