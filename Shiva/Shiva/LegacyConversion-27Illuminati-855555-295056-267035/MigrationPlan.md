# COBOL to .NET Blazor Server Migration â€“ Requirement Scenarios

## 1. Account Data Migration
- Migrate customer account data from COBOL data files to an in-memory .NET data structure.
- Ensure data integrity and consistency during migration.

## 2. User Authentication & Authorization
- Implement secure login for users (bank staff or customers).
- Restrict access to account operations based on user roles.

## 3. Account Operations
- **View account balance:** Users can retrieve and display current balances.
- **Credit account:** Users can add funds to an account.
- **Debit account:** Users can withdraw funds, with validation to prevent overdrafts.

## 4. Business Logic Preservation
- Re-implement all COBOL business rules in C#.
- Ensure calculations and validations match COBOL logic.

## 5. Transaction Logging
- Record all account operations (credit, debit, balance inquiry) in an in-memory transaction log.
- Provide a way to view transaction history per account.

## 6. Error Handling & Validation
- Display user-friendly error messages for invalid operations (e.g., insufficient funds).
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides.

## 7. User Interface
- Build Blazor components for each operation (view, credit, debit).
- Ensure UI is responsive and accessible.

## 8. Testing & Verification
- Create unit and integration tests to verify business logic matches COBOL behavior.
- Validate migration with sample data and edge cases.

## 9. Performance & Scalability
- Ensure the in-memory database can handle expected user load.
- Plan for future migration to a persistent database if needed.
