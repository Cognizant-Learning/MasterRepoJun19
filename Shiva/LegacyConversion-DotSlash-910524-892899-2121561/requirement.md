# Requirements for Legacy Code Migration

## Objective
Migrate the provided legacy COBOL code into a modern, user-friendly web application.

## Functional Requirements
- Reproduce all business logic from the legacy code in the new application.
- Provide a web-based user interface for all user interactions.
- Ensure data input, processing, and output match the legacy system's behavior.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The application should be easy to use and accessible via a web browser.
- Code should be maintainable and well-documented.
- Ensure security best practices for web applications.

## Deliverables
- Source code for the web application.
- Documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.
- Test cases to verify correctness of the migrated logic.

## Constraints
- The migration should not introduce regressions or change the core business logic.
- Use modern web technologies (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue for frontend; Node.js, Python, or similar for backend).

## Timeline
- Complete migration and initial testing within the project deadline.
