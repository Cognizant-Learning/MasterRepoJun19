# Prompts and Requirements for COBOL Code Migration UI

## Functional Prompts
- Reproduce all business logic from the legacy COBOL code in the new application.
- Provide a web-based user interface for all user interactions.
- Ensure data input, processing, and output match the legacy system's behavior.

## Non-Functional Prompts
- The application should be easy to use and accessible via a web browser.
- Code should be maintainable and well-documented.
- Ensure security best practices for web applications.

## Deliverables
- Source code for the web application.
- Documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.
- Test cases to verify correctness of the migrated logic.

## Constraints
- The migration should not introduce regressions or change the core business logic.
- Use modern web technologies (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue for frontend; Node.js, Python, or similar for backend).

## Timeline
- Complete migration and initial testing within the project deadline.

## UI/UX Prompts
- The UI should be professional, responsive, and visually appealing.
- Provide clear prompts for user actions (menu, input, confirmation, errors).
- Display messages and transaction results clearly.
- If enhanced: add transaction history, CSV/PDF download, and navigation features.

## Migration Prompts
- Map COBOL menu and business logic to React components and state.
- Simulate persistent balance storage as in COBOL data.cob.
- Implement credit, debit, and balance operations as in operations.cob.
- Ensure all user interactions are handled via the web interface.
