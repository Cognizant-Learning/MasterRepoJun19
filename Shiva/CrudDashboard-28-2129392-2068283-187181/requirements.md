# Intelligent Inventory Hub - Technical Requirements

## Project Overview
The Intelligent Inventory Hub is a single-page web application designed to help business owners efficiently manage their inventory. The system provides a centralized dashboard with real-time inventory visibility and management capabilities.

## Core User Story
"As a store manager, I want to see all my items in a central dashboard, be able to add, update, and remove stock instantly, and get quick insights into my inventory's health, so I can make smarter decisions and stop wasting time on manual data entry."

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Interface

#### 1.1 Key Statistics Panel
- **Requirement:** Display summary statistics at the top of the dashboard
- **Elements:**
  - Total unique items count
  - Items low on stock count (quantity < threshold)
  - Items out of stock count (quantity = 0)
- **Behavior:** Statistics must update in real-time when inventory changes

#### 1.2 Inventory Table
- **Requirement:** Interactive table displaying all inventory items
- **Columns:**
  - Item Name
  - SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
  - Category
  - Price
  - Quantity
- **Features:**
  - Sortable columns (clicking column header sorts by that field)
  - Pagination (if number of items exceeds display limit)
  - Row highlighting for low stock items

#### 1.3 Search and Filter
- **Requirement:** Real-time filtering capability
- **Implementation:**
  - Single search input field
  - Filters across all columns simultaneously
  - Updates results as user types
  - Clear filter option

### 2. CRUD Operations

#### 2.1 Create Item
- **Requirement:** Add new items to inventory
- **Implementation:**
  - Form or modal with fields for all required item data
  - Input validation for all fields
  - Success confirmation on submission
- **Required Fields:**
  - Item Name (text)
  - SKU (unique identifier, text)
  - Category (text/dropdown)
  - Price (numeric, currency)
  - Quantity (numeric, integer)

#### 2.2 Update Item
- **Requirement:** Modify existing item details
- **Implementation:**
  - Edit button on each table row
  - Pre-populated form/modal with current item data
  - Input validation for all fields
  - Success confirmation on submission

#### 2.3 Delete Item
- **Requirement:** Remove items from inventory
- **Implementation:**
  - Delete button on each table row
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Success notification after deletion
  - Immediate removal from the table view

#### 2.4 Low Stock Alert
- **Requirement:** Visual indication for items low in stock
- **Implementation:**
  - Define threshold value (default: 10 units)
  - Apply visual styling (yellow/orange background) to rows with quantity below threshold
  - Apply different visual styling (red background) to rows with zero quantity

## Technical Specifications

### Data Model
- **Item Object Structure:**
  ```
  {
    id: string/number,      // Unique identifier
    name: string,           // Item name
    sku: string,            // Stock keeping unit (unique)
    category: string,       // Item category
    price: number,          // Item price
    quantity: number,       // Current stock quantity
    createdAt: timestamp,   // Creation date
    updatedAt: timestamp    // Last update date
  }
  ```

### State Management
- Application must maintain consistent state across all components
- CRUD operations must update the UI immediately
- Statistics must recalculate after any inventory change

### Performance Requirements
- Table filtering/search must execute in under 300ms
- CRUD operations should complete within 1 second
- Dashboard should load within 2 seconds

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Application must function on latest versions of:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Edge

### Responsive Design
- Dashboard must be fully functional on:
  - Desktop (min-width: 1024px)
  - Tablet (min-width: 768px)
  - Mobile devices (min-width: 320px)

## Potential Stretch Goals

### Data Visualization
- Add charts displaying:
  - Item distribution by category
  - Stock level overview

### Image Upload
- Allow users to upload and display product images
- Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG)
- Image optimization for performance

### Bulk Operations
- Select multiple items via checkboxes
- Perform batch delete operations
- Possibly batch update for common fields

### Activity Logging
- Track and display recent user actions
- Show last 5-10 operations
- Include timestamp and operation type

## Implementation Priorities
1. Dashboard view with table and statistics
2. Search and filter functionality
3. Core CRUD operations
4. Low stock alerts
5. Stretch goals (if time permits)

## Definition of Done
- All functional requirements implemented
- Code passes all unit and integration tests
- UI is responsive across required device sizes
- Application loads and performs within specified time constraints
