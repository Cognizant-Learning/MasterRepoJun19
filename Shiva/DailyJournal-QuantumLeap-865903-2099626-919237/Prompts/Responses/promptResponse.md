Let me outline the key data points we should capture based on the project requirements:

Journal Entry Data Points
Core Entry Data

Entry ID (unique identifier)
Title
Content (main journal text)
Creation timestamp
Last modified timestamp
Mood Data

Mood selection (from predefined options):
Happy üòä
Excited üéâ
Calm üòå
Neutral üòê
Sad üò¢
Anxious üò∞
Angry üò†
Mood intensity level (1-5 scale)
Mood timestamp
Here's a suggested data model structur

export interface JournalEntry {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    content: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    mood: {
        type: MoodType;
        intensity: number;
        timestamp: Date;
    }
}

export enum MoodType {
    HAPPY = 'HAPPY',
    EXCITED = 'EXCITED',
    CALM = 'CALM',
    NEUTRAL = 'NEUTRAL',
    SAD = 'SAD',
    ANXIOUS = 'ANXIOUS',
    ANGRY = 'ANGRY'
}


ptional Metadata (if time permits)
Tags/Categories
Weather (could be auto-fetched)
Location
Activities/Events of the day
Sleep hours
Energy level
This structure provides enough data points for meaningful mood tracking and analysis while keeping the user input process simple and straightforward.
