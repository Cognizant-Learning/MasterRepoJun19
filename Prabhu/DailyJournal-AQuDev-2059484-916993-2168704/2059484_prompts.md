## Prompts/Instructions Used
- "Create a React js mobile/web dashboard app for a Daily Journal & Mood Analyzer. Make the app reactive for all screens and add a sign in/sign up page and screens to fetch the data from a dummy backend and display the previous daily journals with icons/svgs to show the users mood."
- "Make the UI a bit more interesting by adding a minimalistic view and add a option for darkmode with animations if possible."
- "Seems the content is not center aligned, please fix that and add enhancements for routing for the user profile, settings, app info, charts/analytics etc."
- "Update the prompts used into the 2059484_prompts.md file."
- "Can you make the mood icons a bit more visible."
- "Also, keep on updating the 2059484_prompts.md file each every prompt I provide for tracking."
- "Can you add caching to the app where the theme selector is part of the settings, also add a graph chart in the analytics section based on the last 7 days data."
- "Can you make the app more web browser focused, the layout seems mobile based with a lot of empty space."
- "Can you make the analytics chart a bit more visually appealing, also can you use layouts to display data and also a panel to display motivation quotes in the home."
- "Can we update the UI to use a organized card layout to display the journals, settings and the other options."
- "Update the UI, use a dual tone dark theme with dark blue and navy as primary backgrounds, use white and neon accents for text and data highlights, all containers should have rounded corners and minimal drop shadows for a neumorphic feel, font should be clean and minimal, layout should be left to right in web and top to bottom in mobile screen, starting with the add journal card, with the different moods, then a card to show the analysis/chart with the last 7 days overall mood, and another card to show the moods for each day per hour on click."
