# Project Brief: VibeCoding CRUD Dashboard

## Overview
The project involves developing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) dashboard for managing data related to returns resolution. The dashboard will provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the underlying data, ensuring efficient workflows and seamless user experience.

## Objectives
1. **CRUD Operations**: Implement functionality to create, read, update, and delete records.
2. **Returns Resolver**: Focus on resolving returns efficiently through the dashboard.
3. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly and responsive interface.
4. **Data Management**: Ensure robust handling of data, including validation and error handling.
5. **Scalability**: Build the system to accommodate future growth and additional features.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Record Management**:
   - Add new records.
   - View existing records.
   - Edit records.
   - Delete records.

2. **Search and Filter**:

   - Provide filtering options for narrowing down data views.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Secure access to the dashboard with user authentication.
   - Role-based access control for different user types.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Display meaningful error messages for invalid operations.
   - Log errors for debugging purposes.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the dashboard works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**:
   - Optimize for fast loading times and smooth interactions.
   - Handle large datasets efficiently.

2. **Security**:
   - Protect sensitive data with encryption.
   - Implement secure APIs for data access.

3. **Maintainability**:
