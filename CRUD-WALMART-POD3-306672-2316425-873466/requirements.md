# Requirements Document: VibeCoding-CRUD-Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview

Develop a single-page inventory management dashboard tailored for business owners. The application must prioritize usability, speed, and actionable insights.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Dashboard View

- **Key Statistics**
  - Display total number of unique inventory items.
  - Show count of items low on stock (quantity below a configurable threshold, e.g., 10).
  - Show count of items out of stock (quantity = 0).

- **Inventory Table**
  - Present a sortable table with columns: Name, SKU, Category, Price, Quantity.
  - Enable sorting by any column.

- **Search & Filter**
  - Provide a single search bar for real-time filtering of inventory items by any field.

### 2.2 Core CRUD Operations

- **Create**
  - Allow users to add new inventory items via a form or modal dialog.

- **Update**
  - Provide an edit button for each row to modify item details.

- **Delete**
  - Provide a delete button for each row.
  - Require confirmation before deletion.

### 2.3 Low Stock Alert

- Visually highlight items in the table:
  - Use a yellow background for items with quantity below the threshold.
  - Use a red background for items out of stock.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The dashboard must update and filter data in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and accessible for non-technical users.
- **Responsiveness:** The application must be usable on both desktop and tablet devices.
- **Data Integrity:** All CRUD operations must validate input and prevent invalid data entry.

---

## 4. Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)

- **Data Visualization:** Display a bar or pie chart showing item quantities by category.
- **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload and display product images during create/edit operations.
- **Bulk Operations:** Enable batch deletion of items using checkboxes.
- **Activity Log:** Show a panel listing the last 5â€“10 user actions (e.g., item created, updated, deleted).

---

## 5. Summary

The MVP is a CRUD inventory dashboard with real-time search, visual low-stock alerts, and key statistics. Stretch goals include analytics, media support, batch actions, and activity tracking for an enhanced user experience.
