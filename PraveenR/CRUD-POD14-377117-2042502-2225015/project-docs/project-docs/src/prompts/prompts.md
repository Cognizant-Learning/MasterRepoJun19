Analyse the current requirements from the Projectbrief.md file and create me business requirement doucment and save it in requirement.md file 

Please save all my prompts throughtout in prompts.md file

> Copilot: Sure, here's a proposed directory structure for a documentation

extract and distil the project brief into a comprehensive requirements.md file. Through thorough analysis, develop a detailed requirement document that serves as a foundational blueprint for application. This document should encapsulate all essential features and technical specifications. 


> Copilot: I'll create a comprehensive requirements.md file based on the project brief analysis. I'll organize it into functional requirements, technical specifications, and user interface requirements.

Please use the requirements.md file to create below API for below task.
Begin by creating a new ASP.NET Core Web API project named Inventory_WebApiApp using .NET 8. Initialize a solution folder and include all essential files. Configure the foundational architecture following Clean Architecture principles, including separate layers for:
Core (for domain entities and interfaces),
Application (for services and DTOs),
Infrastructure (for data access, EF Core setup),
WebAPI (for controllers and startup logic).
SQL Server details: Servername: 6da144c2d3ef57a, Database: VibeCodingDb, UserName: sa, Password: pass@word1
Set up appsettings.json for configuration and implement dependency injection for services and repositories. Register Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. Create a sample Product entity with CRUD operations and include one service that encapsulates business logic for it.
Build out proper routing, CORS settings, logging via Serilog, and environment-based configurations. Configure Entity Framework Core with code-first migrations using a PostgreSQL database. Add basic unit tests using xUnit or NUnit, and integration tests using WebApplicationFactory.

Let me help you set up the ASP.NET Core Web API solution with Clean Architecture. I'll create the solution and all the necessary projects. 

can you make current api to work

> Copilot: I'll help you get the API working. Let me first check the current state of the projects and fix any issues. Let me check the current state of the database migrations and make sure they're properly set up. Let me first check if all required packages are installed and ensure the database connection is working. I'll run some commands to verify and fix any issues: 

#terminalSelection /fix the issue

> Copilot: I'll help you fix the API issues. Let's follow these steps:

not able browse at Swagger UI: https://localhost:7001/swagger


> Copilot: Let me help you fix the Swagger UI issue. First, let's verify the Program.cs configuration for Swagger:

> ````csharp

> 
> Now, let's make sure all required packages are installed. Run these commands in the terminal:

> ````powershell
> cd src/InventoryAPI.WebAPI
> dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore --version 6.5.0
> dotnet build
> dotnet run --launch-profile https
> ````
> 
> The API should now be accessible at:
> - https://localhost:5001/swagger
> - http://localhost:5000/swagger
> 
> If you're still having issues, check if:
> 1. The application is running (check the terminal output for the actual port number)
> 2. There are no other applications using the same port
> 3. The SSL certificate is trusted (you might need to accept it in your browser)
> 
> You can also try running with HTTP only for testing:
> 
> ````powershell
> dotnet run --urls="http://localhost:5000"
> ````
> 
> The Swagger UI should then be available at `http://localhost:5000/swagger`.

dotnet run --urls="http://localhost:5000"

> Copilot: Let me help you set up the correct configuration for running the API. First, let's update the Program.cs file:

can we test CreateProduct end point with mock data

> Copilot: I'll help you test the CreateProduct endpoint using Swagger UI or Postman. First, let's create a sample JSON payload for testing:
> 
> ```json
> {
>   "name": "Test Product",
>   "sku": "TST-001",
>   "category": "Electronics",
>   "price": 99.99,
>   "quantity": 50,
>   "imageUrl": "https://example.com/test-product.jpg"
> }
> ```
> 
> To test this endpoint:
> 
> 1. Start the API by running these commands in the terminal:
> ```powershell
> cd src/InventoryAPI.WebAPI
> dotnet run --urls="http://localhost:5000"
> ```
> 
> 2. Open Swagger UI in your browser:
> - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
> - Find the POST `/api/Products` endpoint
> - Click "Try it out"
> - Paste the JSON payload above into the Request body
> - Click "Execute"
> 
> Alternatively, using Postman:
> 1. Create a new POST request
> 2. Set URL to `http://localhost:5000/api/Products`
> 3. Set Headers:
>    - `Content-Type: application/json`
> 4. In Body tab:
>    - Select "raw"
>    - Select "JSON"
>    - Paste the sample JSON payload
> 5. Click Send
> 
> Expected successful response:
> - Status: 201 Created
> - Response body should contain the created product with an assigned ID
> 
> If you prefer using curl in the terminal:
> ```powershell
> curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/Products" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"Test Product\",\"sku\":\"TST-001\",\"category\":\"Electronics\",\"price\":99.99,\"quantity\":50,\"imageUrl\":\"https://example.com/test-product.jpg\"}"
> ```

can you add to gitignore for the files whatever is necessary

create a comprehensive .gitignore file for your ASP.NET Core project

> Copilot: I'll help you create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for your ASP.NET Core project. I'll create it in the root of your project: I've created a comprehensive .gitignore file that:
> 
> 1. Ignores build outputs (`bin/`, `obj/`)
> 2. Ignores IDE-specific files (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider)
> 3. Ignores logs and sensitive configuration files
> 4. Ignores database files
> 5. Ignores NuGet package files
> 6. Ignores user-specific files
> 7. Ignores OS-generated files
> 8. Ignores test results and coverage reports
> 9. Preserves important VS Code configuration files while ignoring workspace-specific ones
> 
> The .gitignore is now in place at the root of your project. You can now safely use Git commands, and these files will be automatically excluded from version control.
> 
> Would you like me to initialize the Git repository as well, or would you like to do something else with the project?
