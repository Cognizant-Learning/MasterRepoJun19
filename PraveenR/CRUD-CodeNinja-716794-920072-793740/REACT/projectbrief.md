## Overview
> The Inventory Management Tool is designed to help users efficiently track and manage inventory items. The application will provide a dashboard view of inventory data, including total unique items, low stock items, and out-of-stock items. Users will be able to add, edit, and delete inventory items. Low and out-of-stock items will be visually highlighted using warning colors for quick identification.
