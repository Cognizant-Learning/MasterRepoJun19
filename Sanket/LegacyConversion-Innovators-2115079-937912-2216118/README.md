## The Challenge: Legacy Code conversion to UI Application

### Details: 
The goal of this challenge is to migrate the provided legacy code to UI Application.
Your mission for the day is to create a user-friendly web interface which gets migrated from the legacy code.

## Completed Migration

This project has successfully migrated the original COBOL-based Account Management System to a modern JavaScript web application.

### Original COBOL Components:
- **MainProgram (main.cob)**: User interface and program control
- **Operations (operations.cob)**: Business logic for account operations  
- **DataProgram (data.cob)**: Data persistence layer

### JavaScript Implementation:
- **main.js**: UI controller and event handling
- **operations.js**: Business logic for account operations
- **data.js**: Data persistence using localStorage

## Features
- View current account balance
- Credit (deposit) funds to account
- Debit (withdraw) funds from account with validation
- Transaction history (enhancement from original)
- Responsive UI design

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. No additional setup required - the application uses browser localStorage

## Implementation Notes
- The initial account balance is set to 1000.00
- All monetary values support 2 decimal places
- The application prevents debit transactions with insufficient funds
- Transaction history is limited to the last 10 transactions
