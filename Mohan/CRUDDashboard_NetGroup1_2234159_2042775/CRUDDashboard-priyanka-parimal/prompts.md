# Project Prompts

## Core User Story
"As a store manager, I want to see all my items in a central dashboard, be able to add, update, and remove stock instantly, and get quick insights into my inventory's health, so I can make smarter decisions and stop wasting time on manual data entry."

## MVP Requirements
- Show key stats: Total Unique Items, Items Low on Stock, Items Out of Stock.
- Display a clean, sortable inventory table with columns: Name, SKU, Category, Price, Quantity.
- Provide a real-time search/filter bar.
- Allow creating, updating, and deleting items (with confirmation for delete).
- Visually highlight low stock items (e.g., quantity < 10).

## Stretch Goals
- Add data visualization (bar/pie chart of quantities by category).
- Allow image uploads for items.
- Implement batch delete with checkboxes.
- Show an activity log of recent actions.

## Process Prompts
- Utilize the chat pane within Edit Mode to meticulously extract and distil the project brief into a comprehensive requirements.md file. Through thorough analysis, develop a detailed requirement document that serves as a foundational blueprint for application. This document should encapsulate all essential features and technical specifications.
- Requirements captured in requirements.md file and continue capturing the Prompts used in prompts.md file.
