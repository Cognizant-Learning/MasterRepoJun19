I want to migrate these legacy code for banking applications written in COBOl to java-react based modern technology. 
Provide me what can be the strategy for doing this.

> Copilot: To migrate your COBOL banking application to a modern Java (backend) + React (frontend) stack, you should follow a structured strategy. Here’s a recommended approach:
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 1. **Assessment & Planning**
> - **Analyze COBOL Code:** Understand the business logic, data flow, and dependencies in your COBOL programs (main.cob, operations.cob, data.cob).
> - **Identify Functionalities:** List all features (view balance, credit, debit, etc.).
> - **Define Requirements:** Document what needs to be preserved, improved, or added in the new system.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 2. **Architecture Design**
> - **Backend:** Use Java (Spring Boot recommended) for business logic and RESTful APIs.
> - **Frontend:** Use React for the user interface.
> - **Data Storage:** Choose a modern database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to replace COBOL’s in-memory/data file storage.
> - **API Contracts:** Define REST endpoints for operations (e.g., `/balance`, `/credit`, `/debit`).
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 3. **Data Migration**
> - **Extract Data:** If COBOL uses files or VSAM, extract and transform data into a relational database format.
> - **Migrate Data:** Load the data into your new database.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 4. **Code Migration**
> - **Business Logic:** Rewrite COBOL logic in Java (Spring Boot services/controllers).
>     - Example: `Operations` program logic → Java service methods.
>     - Example: `DataProgram` storage logic → Java repository/database access.
> - **User Interface:** Recreate the CLI menu as a React web app.
>     - Replace `DISPLAY` and `ACCEPT` with React forms and components.
> - **Integrate:** Connect React frontend to Java backend via REST APIs.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 5. **Testing**
> - **Unit Tests:** Write tests for Java services.
> - **Integration Tests:** Ensure frontend and backend work together.
> - **User Acceptance Testing:** Validate with end-users.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 6. **Deployment**
> - **DevOps:** Use Docker, CI/CD pipelines for deployment.
> - **Cloud/On-prem:** Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, etc.) or on-premises as needed.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 7. **Training & Cutover**
> - **Train Users:** Provide documentation and training for the new system.
> - **Go Live:** Switch from COBOL to the new system after thorough testing.

> ### **Sample Mapping Table**
> 
> | COBOL Concept         | Java/React Equivalent         |
> |-----------------------|------------------------------|
> | `DISPLAY`/`ACCEPT`    | React UI Components/Forms    |
> | `CALL` (program)      | Java Service/Method Call     |
> | Working-Storage       | Java Class Fields/Variables  |
> | Data File/VSAM        | Relational Database (JPA)    |
> | Main Loop             | React Navigation/State Mgmt  |
> 
> ---
> 
> **Tip:** Start with a small, non-critical module to pilot the migration and refine your approach.
