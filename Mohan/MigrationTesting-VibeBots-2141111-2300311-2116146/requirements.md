I want to migrate these legacy code for banking applications written in COBOl to java-react based modern technology. 
Provide me what can be the strategy for doing this.

> Copilot: To migrate your COBOL banking application to a modern Java (backend) + React (frontend) stack, you should follow a structured strategy. Here’s a recommended approach:
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 1. **Assessment & Planning**
> - **Analyze COBOL Code:** Understand the business logic, data flow, and dependencies in your COBOL programs (main.cob, operations.cob, data.cob).
> - **Identify Functionalities:** List all features (view balance, credit, debit, etc.).
> - **Define Requirements:** Document what needs to be preserved, improved, or added in the new system.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 2. **Architecture Design**
> - **Backend:** Use Java (Spring Boot recommended) for business logic and RESTful APIs.
> - **Frontend:** Use React for the user interface.
> - **Data Storage:** Choose a modern database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to replace COBOL’s in-memory/data file storage.
> - **API Contracts:** Define REST endpoints for operations (e.g., `/balance`, `/credit`, `/debit`).
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 3. **Data Migration**
> - **Extract Data:** If COBOL uses files or VSAM, extract and transform data into a relational database format.
> - **Migrate Data:** Load the data into your new database.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 4. **Code Migration**
> - **Business Logic:** Rewrite COBOL logic in Java (Spring Boot services/controllers).
>     - Example: `Operations` program logic → Java service methods.
>     - Example: `DataProgram` storage logic → Java repository/database access.
> - **User Interface:** Recreate the CLI menu as a React web app.
>     - Replace `DISPLAY` and `ACCEPT` with React forms and components.
> - **Integrate:** Connect React frontend to Java backend via REST APIs.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 5. **Testing**
> - **Unit Tests:** Write tests for Java services.
> - **Integration Tests:** Ensure frontend and backend work together.
> - **User Acceptance Testing:** Validate with end-users.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 6. **Deployment**
> - **DevOps:** Use Docker, CI/CD pipelines for deployment.
> - **Cloud/On-prem:** Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, etc.) or on-premises as needed.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 7. **Training & Cutover**
> - **Train Users:** Provide documentation and training for the new system.
> - **Go Live:** Switch from COBOL to the new system after thorough testing.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Sample Mapping Table**
> 
> | COBOL Concept         | Java/React Equivalent         |
> |-----------------------|------------------------------|
> | `DISPLAY`/`ACCEPT`    | React UI Components/Forms    |
> | `CALL` (program)      | Java Service/Method Call     |
> | Working-Storage       | Java Class Fields/Variables  |
> | Data File/VSAM        | Relational Database (JPA)    |
> | Main Loop             | React Navigation/State Mgmt  |

provide the in-depth test cases for migration application for UI for functionalities crediet debit and history

> Copilot: Certainly! Here are **in-depth UI test cases** for the migrated banking application’s main functionalities: **Credit, Debit, and Transaction History**. These can be used for manual testing or automated UI testing (e.g., with Selenium, Cypress, or React Testing Library).
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 1. **Credit Functionality**
> 
> | Test Case ID | Test Description | Steps | Expected Result |
> |--------------|------------------|-------|----------------|
> | UI-CREDIT-01 | Credit with valid amount | 1. Navigate to Credit page<br>2. Enter a valid positive amount (e.g., 500)<br>3. Submit | Success message displayed; balance increases by credited amount; transaction appears in history |
> | UI-CREDIT-02 | Credit with zero amount | 1. Navigate to Credit page<br>2. Enter 0<br>3. Submit | Error message: "Amount must be greater than zero"; no change in balance or history |
> | UI-CREDIT-03 | Credit with negative amount | 1. Navigate to Credit page<br>2. Enter -100<br>3. Submit | Error message: "Amount must be positive"; no change in balance or history |
> | UI-CREDIT-04 | Credit with non-numeric input | 1. Navigate to Credit page<br>2. Enter "abc"<br>3. Submit | Error message: "Invalid amount"; no change in balance or history |
> | UI-CREDIT-05 | Credit with large amount | 1. Navigate to Credit page<br>2. Enter a very large amount (e.g., 99999999)<br>3. Submit | Success or error based on business rules (e.g., max limit); balance and history update accordingly |
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 2. **Debit Functionality**
> 
> | Test Case ID | Test Description | Steps | Expected Result |
> |--------------|------------------|-------|----------------|
> | UI-DEBIT-01 | Debit with valid amount less than balance | 1. Navigate to Debit page<br>2. Enter a valid amount less than current balance<br>3. Submit | Success message; balance decreases by debited amount; transaction appears in history |
> | UI-DEBIT-02 | Debit with amount equal to balance | 1. Navigate to Debit page<br>2. Enter amount equal to current balance<br>3. Submit | Success message; balance becomes zero; transaction appears in history |
> | UI-DEBIT-03 | Debit with amount greater than balance | 1. Navigate to Debit page<br>2. Enter amount greater than current balance<br>3. Submit | Error message: "Insufficient funds"; no change in balance or history |
> | UI-DEBIT-04 | Debit with zero amount | 1. Navigate to Debit page<br>2. Enter 0<br>3. Submit | Error message: "Amount must be greater than zero"; no change in balance or history |
> | UI-DEBIT-05 | Debit with non-numeric input | 1. Navigate to Debit page<br>2. Enter "xyz"<br>3. Submit | Error message: "Invalid amount"; no change in balance or history |
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 3. **Transaction History Functionality**
> 
> | Test Case ID | Test Description | Steps | Expected Result |
> |--------------|------------------|-------|----------------|
> | UI-HIST-01 | View transaction history after login | 1. Login<br>2. Navigate to History page | List of all past transactions (credit/debit) displayed in reverse chronological order |
> | UI-HIST-02 | Verify transaction details | 1. Perform a credit or debit<br>2. Navigate to History page | New transaction appears with correct type, amount, date/time, and resulting balance |
> | UI-HIST-03 | History pagination | 1. Perform multiple transactions to exceed one page<br>2. Navigate to History page<br>3. Use pagination controls | Transactions are paginated; navigation works correctly |
> | UI-HIST-04 | Filter by transaction type | 1. Navigate to History page<br>2. Apply filter for "Credit" or "Debit" | Only transactions of selected type are shown |
> | UI-HIST-05 | No transactions | 1. Ensure account has no transactions<br>2. Navigate to History page | Message: "No transactions found" displayed |
>

> 
> ## 4. **General UI/UX Test Cases**
> 
> | Test Case ID | Test Description | Steps | Expected Result |
> |--------------|------------------|-------|----------------|
> | UI-GEN-01 | Navigation between pages | Use navigation menu to switch between Credit, Debit, and History | Correct page loads; state is preserved as appropriate |
> | UI-GEN-02 | Form validation | Try submitting forms with empty fields | Error messages shown; no API call made |
> | UI-GEN-03 | Loading indicators | Perform credit/debit/history fetch | Loading spinner or indicator shown while waiting for response |
> | UI-GEN-04 | Error handling | Simulate backend/API failure | User-friendly error message displayed; no crash |
>

> **Tip:**  
> Automate these test cases using a tool like Cypress or React Testing Library for regression testing after migration.
